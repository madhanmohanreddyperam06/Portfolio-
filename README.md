## Project Structure

## Notes

- The CSS file (`css/style.css`) is referenced but not present; the site may not display styled properly without it.
- Some images (e.g., university logos in education.html) and the resume PDF are missing from the `assets/` directory.
- Placeholder pages like `about.html`, `certifications.html`, and `contact.html` are linked but not implemented.
- Font Awesome kit ID is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with a valid one for icons to load.
